# Things regarding IDA Pro 7.3 leak

## IDA itself

*TODO: `UPX00` section in `ida64.dll`?*

## HexRays Decompiler

Made x64 decompiler (`hexx64.dll`) from IDA Pro 7.2 compatible with IDA Pro 7.3.

![We all like proof of concept screenshots](hexx64_7.2_7.3.png)

*TODO: Description on what has been done*

Apparently I cannot upload the modded binary and/or the original ones without [having GitHub yell at me](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-04-05-HexRays.md) to [take it down](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2019/09/2019-09-12-Hex-Rays.md), so here is a binary diff in <hexx64_7.2_7.3.txt>.
