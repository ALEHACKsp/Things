# TODO

**UPDATE:** ReactOS has already done what I've been doing.
- https://github.com/reactos/reactos/blob/master/sdk/include/reactos/drivers/ntddrdsk.h
- https://github.com/reactos/reactos/blob/master/drivers/storage/class/ramdisk/ramdisk.c
However their implementation seems to be based on Windows XP (IMAGESOURCE_RAM is missing), so I'm leaving my results here.

*Research report coming soon*
